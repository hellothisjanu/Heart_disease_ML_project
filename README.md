# Heart_disease_ML_project

The Python code starts by importing the required libraries, which include pandas for data handling, sklearn modules for machine learning tasks, such as train_test_split for model selection, accuracy_score, and confusion_matrix for metrics evaluation, and pandas for data preprocessing (StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder). After that, a pandas DataFrame is loaded with a dataset ('heart.csv') that contains clinical data on heart illness. The first few rows of the dataset are shown to provide an overview. In order to visually examine the distribution and correlations between features—which are essential for comprehending relationships within the dataset—the algorithm creates a pairplot using Seaborn. Using pd.get_dummies, one-hot encoding transforms categorical information into numerical values so that they may be utilized in machine learning models. To ensure model assessment on unseen data, train_test_split divides the dataset into training and testing sets, using 70% for training and 30% for testing. StandardScaler is used to standardize features and normalize data across scales, improving model performance. After that, 100 decision trees are used to start a Random Forest classifier, which is subsequently trained using the same training set. Using measures like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, the trained model assesses its performance in predicting the target variable (HeartDisease) on the test set. Lastly, Seaborn's heatmap is used to show the confusion matrix, offering insights into the model's prediction performance for various heart disease classifications. This process illustrates a thorough method for developing and assessing a machine learning model that uses the Random Forest algorithm to predict cardiac disease.
